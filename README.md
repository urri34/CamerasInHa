# CamerasInHa

Things I have learned about IP Cams in Home Assistant environment. I like to use POE cams and each one has it's one special things wich sometimes are really driving me crazy.

- [IpCams]IpCams.md](IpCams.md). Usually bought from Aliexpress this kind of cheap cameras are usufull but triky.
- [ESP32-Cam](Esp32Cam.md). Tiny wonderful cameras with thousands of usefull options.
